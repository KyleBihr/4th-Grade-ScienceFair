Liam's 4th grade science fair project

This repo contains source supporting Liam's 4th grade science fair project.

Goal of the project is to determine the effect of temperature on magnet strength. The magneotmeter on the Raspberry Pi Sense Hat will be used to measure the magnetic flux density. The magnetometer.py file access then sense hat and records the readings.

Note: the sense hat takes 10-12 recordings before the it settles down to a stable value.
